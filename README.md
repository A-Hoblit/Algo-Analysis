# Algo-Analysis

These Files are all a part of an Algorithms project for CSUF spring 2022

There are 5 total algorithms, with tests.

1. Date Reformat - O(n) - Takes a string input and verifies and reformats it to Y-M-D format
2. Run Length Encode - O(nm) - Converts a string input to a string where each sequentially repeating character is counted. EX: "heloooooooo there" becomes "hel8o there"
3. Soccor Avoidance Dynamic - O(n^2) - Dynamically navigates an nxm "field" to find every valid route from corner to corner.
4. Longest Frequent Substring - O(n^3) - Takes a string and returns the longes string such that every character is repeated in the original string K times.
5. Soccor Avoidance Exhaustive - O(n2^n) - Exhaustively navigates an nxm "field" to find every valid route from corner to corner.

A simple timer was used to graph the runtimes over thousands of iterations.
